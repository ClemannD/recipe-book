# Recipe Book

![Recipe Book](shared-recipes-page.png)

A simple webb app to store and share recipes, as well as create meal plans.

This project was built over a couple days of after work hacking. The code is somewhat sloppy, as my goal was to see how fast I could get a to a useable product with the current TS/React ecosystem. I used Github Copilot extensively to aid in going fast as well
